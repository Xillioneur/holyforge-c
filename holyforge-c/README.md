# HolyForge Games Website (Holy C Edition)

This website is generated by a custom Static Site Generator (SSG) written entirely in **C**. It is designed to be extremely fast, secure, and hosted for free on Cloudflare Pages.

## Why C?
- **Performance**: Zero overhead.
- **Unified Stack**: Our studio develops games in C/C++, so our web infrastructure should be just as powerful.
- **Simplicity**: No complex dependencies or heavy frameworks.

## Local Development

### 1. Build the Site
You need a C compiler (like `gcc` or `clang`) and `make`.
```bash
cd holyforge-c
make
```
This will compile the generator and create the `public/` directory with all your HTML files.

### 2. View the Site
You can open `public/index.html` in any browser, or use a simple server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server -d public
```

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment

1.  Push this code to GitHub.
2.  Connect your repository to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
3.  Set the **Build Command** to: `cd holyforge-c && make`
4.  Set the **Build Output Directory** to: `holyforge-c/public`

Cloudflare will run your C code to generate the site and then host it globally for **$0**.
